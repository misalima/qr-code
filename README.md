## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I practiced centering elements using flexbox, and also the use of media queries to work on responsiveness.

### Continued development

Since I have been in contact with Html and Css for a while, I didn't have much trouble with this particular project. However, I noticed that in the future I need to improve my understanding of flexbox positioning.
